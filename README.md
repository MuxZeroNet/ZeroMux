# ZeroMux Bundle

This repo is deprecated. Please upload large files directly onto ZeroNet, which handles large files much better.

If you are looking for JavaScript Torrent libraries, check out [WebTorrent](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent).

If you are looking for "adaptive bitrate" streaming libraries, check out [DASH.js](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js).

If you are looking for video transmuxing libraries written in JavaScript, check out [FLV.js](https://github.com/Bilibili/flv.js/).

However, it is better to transmux your videos on the server side. If you are trying to produce [fragmented MP4 files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35177797/what-exactly-is-fragmented-mp4fmp4-how-is-it-different-from-normal-mp4#35180327), check out [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8616855/how-to-output-fragmented-mp4-with-ffmpeg).

If you are confused, don't encode your videos into MP4. It _is_ a mess. There is [a better alternative](https://www.webmproject.org/).
